# Simple Expression and Polynomial Compiler

This is a simple compiler implemented in C++ that performs parsing, intermediate instruction generation, and evaluation of:
- **Arithmetic expressions** (like `2 + 3 * (4 - 1)`)
- **Polynomials** (like `3x^2 + 2x + 1`, evaluated at a given value of `x`)

## ðŸ“‹ Features

### Arithmetic Expression Parser
- Supports `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operators
- Handles parentheses for precedence
- Generates intermediate **assembly-like instructions** (e.g., `ADD`, `MUL`, etc.)
- Detects syntax errors like invalid characters and division by zero

### Polynomial Parser and Evaluator
- Parses polynomial expressions with `x` and powers (e.g., `2x^3 - 4x + 7`)
- Evaluates the polynomial for a given value of `x`
- Displays step-by-step computation (e.g., power, multiplication, summing up terms)

## ðŸ›  How It Works

When you run the program, you are prompted to:
- Press `1` to evaluate a polynomial
- Press `2` to parse an arithmetic expression

Depending on the choice:
- **Arithmetic expressions** are parsed and instructions are printed.
- **Polynomials** are evaluated numerically, with detailed steps printed.

## âœ… Example Usage

### Arithmetic Mode (`2`)
```bash
Enter '1' for polynomial evaluation or '2' for arithmetic expressions: 2
Enter an arithmetic expression: 2 + 3 * (4 - 1)
Generated Instructions:
SUB 4 1 -> temp0
MUL 3 temp0 -> temp1
ADD 2 temp1 -> temp2
